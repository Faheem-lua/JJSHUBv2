Your MAIN account will get banned if a mod bans one of your alts.

If that happens every account you used on your device will be banned.

ALL of your OLD alts will ban your main so don't use them.

To avoid your MAIN account getting banned on PC do this:

1- Make new alt accounts from Google or any Web browser, NEVER play on them, wait until one alt gets banned then use the next


2- Spoof your MAC address

A mod bans you -> spoof your MAC -> use an alt you have never played on.
